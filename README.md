### Web Application

The web applications is part of an academic project. We're working on creating a site where one can simply create, identify, track, print, and share QR codes.

-or-

A website to replace your pet's ID tag.


### iPhone

There is currently an iPhone application available on the app store. It's FREE.

The next version is in the process of being reviewed -- a bug stands in its way.


### Android

TagDog on Android would be great, but it's not within our scope.

It will be available someday as I begin to dive into Java.
